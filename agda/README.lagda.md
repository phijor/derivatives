# Removing Isolated Points in Univalent Foundations

```agda
open import Derivative.Isolated
```

Definition 2.1: Isolated points.
```agda
_ : (a : A) → Type _
_ = isIsolated
```

Lemma 2.2: Isolated points have propositional paths.
```agda
_ : (a : A) → isIsolated a → (b : A) → isProp (a ≡ b)
_ = isIsolated→isPropPath
```

Corollary 2.3: Being isolated is a proposition.
```agda
_ : (a : A) → isProp (isIsolated a)
_ = isPropIsIsolated
```

Proposition 2.4: Isolated points form a set.
```agda
_ : isSet (A °)
_ = isSetIsolated
```

**Lemma 2.5**:
Equivalences preserve and reflect isolated points, hence induce an equivalence.
```agda
_ : (e : A ≃ B) → ∀ a → isIsolated a ≃ isIsolated (equivFun e a)
_ = isIsolated≃isIsolatedEquivFun
```

This induces an equivalence on sets of isolated points:
```agda
_ : (e : A ≃ B) → A ° ≃ B °
_ = IsolatedSubstEquiv
```

**Proposition 2.6**:
Embeddings reflect isolated points.
```agda
_ : (f : A → B) → isEmbedding f → ∀ {a} → isIsolated (f a) → isIsolated a
_ = EmbeddingReflectIsolated
```

**Proposition 2.7**:
The constructors `inl : A → A ⊎ B` and `inr : B → A ⊎ B` preserve and reflect isolated points.
```agda
_ : ∀ {a : A} → isIsolated a ≃ isIsolated (inl {B = B} a)
_ = isIsolated≃isIsolatedInl

_ : ∀ {b : B} → isIsolated b ≃ isIsolated (inr {A = A} b)
_ = isIsolated≃isIsolatedInr
```

**Problem 2.8**:
The above induces an equivalence that distributes isolated points over binary sums:
```agda
_ : (A ⊎ B) ° ≃ (A °) ⊎ (B °)
_ = IsolatedSumEquiv
```
