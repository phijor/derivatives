\section*{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    In \cite{AbbottEtAl2003DerivativesContainers}, \citeauthor{AbbottEtAl2003DerivativesContainers} consider the general adjunction \( \Blank \CTimes H \dashv [H, \Blank] \),
    perhaps we can make more progress towards that? By iterating ours, it should be possible to derive \( \Blank \CTimes \Op{K}(n) \dashv \Der^n \).
    For combinatorial species, this is enough to derive the fully general adjunction, since (1) the \( \Op{K}(n) \) are exactly the representables
    \( \Op{y}(n) \), (2) every species is a colimit of some \( \Op{y}(n_i) \)'s, and (3) the product (in this case, Day-convolution) is co-continuous.
  \item
    Say something about largest fixed points. Most proofs should generalize to arbitrary fixed points;
    point out which do.
\end{itemize}
